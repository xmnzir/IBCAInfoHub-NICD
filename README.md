# IBCA Information Hub & Semantic FAQ Chatbot
This project delivers a visually interactive information hub for the Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA). Developed collaboratively with Newcastle University colleagues during the National Innovation Centre for Data Spring Bootcamp, it consolidates publicly available data and resources to support understanding of the Infected Blood Inquiry (IBI) and its impact.

The platform includes:

Overview: Background on IBCA, its mission, and the project’s genesis from a broad, exploratory problem statement.

FAQ Chatbot: A semantic search tool that allows users to ask questions and receive relevant answers from curated FAQs.

Basic Info: Summaries, population data, and visualizations of affected groups.

Eligibility & Compensation: Detailed information on compensation schemes and required documentation, including a link to the official IBCA calculator.

Case Studies: Real examples of awards breakdowns to illustrate compensation scenarios.

Contact: Comprehensive IBCA contact information for general enquiries, fraud reporting, and media requests.

While the original challenge of estimating affected individuals could not be fully resolved, the effort provided valuable insights into the issue, motivating the creation of this accessible, educational, and user-friendly platform.
